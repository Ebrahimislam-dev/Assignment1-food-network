                Hi! i am Specialising in Chinese Cuisine, i am stresses on the importance of using fresh ingredients
                in every dish and delighting guests with his gastronomic specialties. I made culinary debut with a
                Chinese restaurant some 30 years ago and has since moved away from a traditional approach towards an
                innovative style of cooking.

                        Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. I decided to make this dish oven-friendly using
                        less oil, and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes
                        and
                        a nice crisp salad. Tastes great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite!

                        I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in (RN). I had a 3 course meal, with a
                        couple of beers. Considering the quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want a
                        romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger groups
